        "short_description": "Highly integrated, compact PMIC",
        "long_description": "The DA6102 is a highly integrated multi-channel PMIC designed for 2-cell lithium-ion battery powered systems. The wide input voltage range allows direct battery connection for each channel to maximize battery life. The PMIC also includes a highly accurate input current sense with circuit breaker control for battery current sensing and over-current shutdown. The DA6102 integrates two buck regulators, a BuckBoost regulator, a high current buck controller, and two always-on LDOs. This high level of integration combined with high frequency operation (up to 3 MHz) minimizes both PCB size and external component count for the smallest possible solution size. The DA6102 uses extremely low RDSon FETs to enable very high efficiency buck and BuckBoost regulation.",
